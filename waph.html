    <h3>Course Overview</h3>
    <p>This course covers the basics of web application development, including front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). 
      Hands-on activities will cover web app vulnerabilities and attacks. We will learnÂ secure programming ideas and methods to prevent web 
      application vulnerabilities and assaults.
</p>
    <p>TTill date, we have finished Lab-0, Lab-1, Lab-2, Hackathon-1, and Individual project-1.</p>
    <h3>Lab-0 Overview</h3>
    <p>In Lab 0 of the Web Application Programming and Hacking course, I successfully set up my development environment. 
      This entailed creating an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual computer using the UC Sandbox. To improve functioning, 
      I installed necessary applications including apache2, git, sublime text, pandoc, and Chrome browser. 
      I built a private GitHub project and shared it with the instructor, Dr. Phu Phung. The next stages were cloning the repository locally, 
      editing the README.md file, and completing the Lab 0 activities.
    </p>
    <h3>Lab-1 Overview</h3>
    <p>In Lab 1, we will explore the HTTP protocol and web application programming in two parts. 
      Part I focuses on learning how to use Wireshark for HTTP traffic analysis and how to interface with HTTP servers using telnet. 
      The goal is to comprehend HTTP components, methods, and replies. Part II focuses on web application development, 
      with an introduction to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and the implementation of a small web application in C that handles user input.
      We will also look into web application development using PHP, focusing on the differences between HTTP GET and POST requests, 
      as well as the security implications. This extensive lab attempts to provide us a practical grasp of HTTP, CGI, 
      and fundamental web application development.</p>
    <h3>Lab-2 Overview</h3>
    <p>In Lab 2, we must accomplish two assignments related to front-end web development. 
      The first task will be to grasp the fundamentals of HTML and forms. Following that, we will look at JavaScript and the different 
      techniques for incorporating it in an HTML file. Task 2 will cover AJAX, CSS, jQuery, and the integration of web APIs utilizing 
      public APIs, giving you hands-on experience with front-end web development principles.</p>
    <h3>Hackathon-1 Overview</h3>
    <p>TThis hackathon aims to raise awareness about cross-site scripting (XSS) threats. Participants learn about code vulnerabilities, 
      follow OWASP rules, and use safe coding methods to guard against XSS assaults. The laboratory consists of two assignments. 
      Task 1 involves attacking the URL http://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/, which has six degrees of susceptibility 
      to XSS assaults. Task 2 entails preventing XSS attacks by adopting secure coding techniques such as input validation and output sterilization.</p>
    <h3>Individual Project- 1 Overview</h3>
    <p>In this project, we will improve our front-end web programming abilities by creating a Professional Profile Website and 
      putting it on the github.io cloud service. This project comprises general, non-technical, and technical specifications.</p>
