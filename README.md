# Individual Project 1 – Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview and Requirements 

For Individual Project 1, I created a professional profile webpage and hosted it on GitHub. The website showcases my resume, about, skills, and projects,as well as many technological functions such as integrating a joke API, digital clock, analogue clock, displaying my email address, XKCD comic, Hacker News articles, weather API, and flag counter. The primary goals of this project were to improve my front-end web programming abilities and get actual experience deploying websites with GitHub Sites.
